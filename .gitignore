# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
config/database.yml
.rspec

# these should all be checked in to normalise the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# TODO Comment out these rules if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/secrets.yml

## Environment normalisation:
/vendor/bundle

# Database
/db/*.psql
